# Expense Tracker

This project is an expense tracker application for Android.
Work still in progress.

Using this app enables you to keep track where all your money goes.
You can set up a plan of your incomes and expenses, monitor your planned and unplanned expenses and incomes.

The project is created to practise my android and kotlin programming skills.
While creating this app I used the following features of the Android API:

	- Material design
	- Room database
	- Kotlin coroutines
	- Navigation component
	- Animations
	- Recycler Views
	- List Adapters
	- Array Adapters
	- Live data
	- MVVM architecture
