# expense-tracker

This project is an expense tracker application for Android.

Using this app enables you to keep track where all your money goes.
You can set up a plan of your incomes and expenses, monitor your planned and unplanned expenses and incomes.

The project is created to practise my android and kotlin programming skills.
While creating this app I used the following features of the Android API:

	- Material design
	- Room database
	- Kotlin coroutines
	- Navigation component
	- Animations
	- Recycler Views
	- List Adapters
	- Array Adapters
	- Live data
	- MVVM architecture
